# What is Vertical & Horizontal Scaling in Docker?

- Scaling is adjusting the number of containers or the power of a machine
to balance loads for particular tasks or projects.

- **Vertical Scaling** means adding more power to your current machines
by upgrading hardware components to improve capabilities.

- **Horizontal Scaling** means adding more machines to help
balance the workload or handle an increased workload.
