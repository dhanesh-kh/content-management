# Docker Guide

This guide provides an introduction to Docker,
focusing on basic commands and usage.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows developers to build,
test, and deploy applications in isolated containers. Key features include:

- **Containerization**: Package applications and their dependencies
for consistent deployment across environments.

- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamically scale containers for
load balancing and improved performance.

## What is a Docker Image?

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package
that includes everything needed to run an application.
Key features of Docker images:

- **Immutability**: Docker images are read-only
and cannot be altered after creation.

- **Portability**: Docker images can be shared across different environments,
ensuring consistent application behavior.

## Docker Commands

### Logging into Docker Hub

Authenticate with Docker Hub from the command line:

```bash
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub username and password.

### Starting Services

To start all services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts the containers in detached mode.

### Resetting the Testing Environment

To stop services, remove volumes, and restart:

1. Stop services and remove volumes:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down -v
    ```

2. Restart services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Viewing Logs

To view and follow logs from containers:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Shutting Down Services

To stop and remove all running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Docker Images

### Building Images

To build a Docker image based on the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Tagging and Pushing Images to Docker Hub

1. **Tagging**: Tag your local image for Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker tag local-image:tagname username/repository:tag
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    docker tag myapp:latest john/myapp:latest
    ```

2. **Pushing**: Push the tagged image to Docker Hub:

    ```bash
    docker push username/repository:tag
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    docker push john/myapp:latest
    ```
