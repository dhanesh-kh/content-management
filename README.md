# NJIT Student Marketplace (NJIT Business)

## Introduction

A dedicated platform for NJIT students to buy and sell textbooks, lab coats,
PC parts, and more â€” essentially a student-only version of Craigslist.

### Getting Started

Before diving into the development of the NJIT Student Marketplace,
it's important to understand the foundational tools that will make
collaboration and deployment easier: **Git** and **Docker**.
These tools not only streamline the development process
but are also widely used across the tech industry,
making them essential skills to have.

#### Why Learn Git?

Git is a version control system that allows developers
to track changes in their code, collaborate with others,
and maintain a clean and organized workflow.
Using Git and platforms like GitHub makes it easy to manage project history,
 share code with teammates, and contribute to open-source projects.

#### Why Learn Docker?

Docker enables developers to create isolated environments called containers,
which help run applications consistently across different systems.
It allows you to package your application with all its dependencies,
making it easy to develop, test, and deploy without worrying
about system configurations or compatibility issues.
