# What is Virtualization?

- Virtualization is creating a virtual copy of
an entire hardware machine on your own machine.
For example, running an Ubuntu OS instance
on your Windows computer using VirtualBox.

## What is a Container & Containerization?

- A container is like a virtual machine,
except it doesn't virtualize a whole hardware machine;
rather, it is a software package with
the dependencies needed to execute software applications.
